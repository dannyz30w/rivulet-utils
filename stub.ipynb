        "This notebook was developed as part of NSF Grant 2445609 to support accessing and processing public data for middle and high school classroom activities. It's written to be relatively accessible to beginners, but if you have not interacted with computational notebooks or Python before, you may find navigating this tool difficult. (Check out the Show Your Work project for a gentle introduction to computational notebooks for educators!)\n",

        "Our project is focused on supporting data analysis and mechanistic reasoning in science education. In other words, we want students to learn how data provides information about how scientific mechanisms work and how understanding scientific mechanisms can help them to explain and interpret patterns in data. This builds on a long history of research on complex systems and agent-based modeling, and more closely connects that work to current expansions of data analysis across subjects.\n",

        "This tool focuses on connecting to the National Weather Service (NWS) API to access public weather data. The goal is to gather meteorological data (such as precipitation, air temperature, etc.) that can be used to explain and interpret patterns in water quality data. This supports the project's focus on helping students learn how data provides information about *how scientific mechanisms work*."
