    "## Purpose of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was developed as part of NSF Grant 2445609 to support accessing and processing public data for middle and high school classroom activities. It's written to be relatively accessible to beginners, but if you have not interacted with computational notebooks or python before you may find navigating this tool difficult. (Check out the Show Your Work project for a gentle introduction to computational notebooks for educators!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is focused on supporting data analysis and mechanistic reasoning in science education. In other words, we want students to learn how data provides information about _how scientific mechanisms work_, and how understanding scientific mechanisms can help them to _explain and interpret patterns in data_. This builds on a long history of research on complex systems and agent-based modeling, and more closely connects that work to current expansions of data analysis across subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are focused on Water Quality as a phenomenon. While most students understand that poor Water Quality can impact health, they may not know what sorts of pollutants impact water quality, and what kinds of events or conditions lead to reductions in water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data tool allows users to connect to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) water data APIs, search for water quality data streams in an area of interest, and then provides a collection of ways to fitler and search the data to ensure you find datasets that have patterns worth exploring. These kinds of datasets can serve as a launch to examining what WQ is and what are its underlying mechanistic and compositional complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to modify and adapt this script. You may find the USGS' water data APIs documentation [here]() and [here](https://doi-usgs.github.io/dataretrieval-python/) helpful."
