    "## Purpose of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was developed as part of NSF Grant 2445609 to support accessing and processing AirNow data for middle and high school classroom activities. It's written to be relatively accessible to beginners, but if you have not interacted with computational notebooks or Python before, you may find navigating this tool difficult. (Check out the Show Your Work project for a gentle introduction to computational notebooks for educators!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is focused on supporting data analysis and mechanistic reasoning in science education. In other words, we want students to learn how data provides information about _how scientific mechanisms work_ and how understanding scientific mechanisms can help them to _explain and interpret patterns in data_. This builds on a long history of research on complex systems and agent-based modeling, and more closely connects that work to current expansions of data analysis across subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are focused on Air Quality as a phenomenon. While most students understand that poor Air Quality can impact health, they may not know that there are many different kinds of air pollution, each caused by different processes and chemicals. These are reflected by different patterns over the course of a day or year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data tool allows users to connect to the Air Quality System API, search for air quality data streams in an area of interest, identify a date range of interest within that area, and then identify which (if any) of the available data streams recorded observations for _both_ PM2.5 and O3 in that area and time range. These are two key pollutants that impact air quality and that tend to behave very differently over time. These kinds of datasets can serve as a launch to examining what AQ is and what are its underlying mechanistic and compositional complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to modify and adapt this script. You may find the AQS API documentation [here](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) and the `pyaqsapi` documentation [here](https://usepa.github.io/pyaqsapi/) helpful."

One easy way to do this is by asking Google, \"What is the longitude and latitude of [area]?\" You will use the code in this section to use a minimum and maximum latitude and longitude to draw a bounding box around your location of interest. This will filter your future queries to focus only on air quality sensors found within that box. If you don't find any sensors, select a different location or increase the bounding box size."
